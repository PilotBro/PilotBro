## Hi, my name is Nikita.

I live in the resort city of Sochi.

I'm currently going through a 3-month Swift marathon on [**Devrush**](https://devrush.ru). And I am happy to be there because I can improve my communication skills, learn more new interesting things and make friends in the community.

My main job is not IT related. But I am interested in app development.

#### I'm also interested in:
- growing microgreens _(they make me and my family healthier 🥗)_
- airplanes _(they give me wings 🪽😊)_
- Italian language *(I love this country with all my heart 🇮🇹)*
- growing flowers *(they give aesthetic pleasure and peace 🌺)*

and much more...
